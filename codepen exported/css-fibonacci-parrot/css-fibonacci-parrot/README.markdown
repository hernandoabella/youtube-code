A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/melipi/pen/LYymXeN](https://codepen.io/melipi/pen/LYymXeN).

Parrot illustration using the golden ratio. This was my second SCSS project and I really enjoy using it so far! I need to see if I can incorporate some functions but I wanted to post what I had created so far.

The design is based on Helvetiphant's Golden Ratio Parrot on Behance:
